\subsection{Geometry of Image Formation}
This is from week 1 of the course by Upenn on Coursera.
\subsubsection{Camera Modelling}
The thin lens approximation is the key concept here:
As shown in the below picture from Wikipedia:
\begin{figure}[H]

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{"thin lens"}
\end{figure}
\begin{equation}
    \frac{1}{f}=\frac{1}{S_1}+\frac{1}{S_2}
\end{equation}
\subsubsection{Single View Geometry}
Ideas: Unwarp then measure the distances and angles. Or, use vanishing points to get information about the scene.
